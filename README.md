# ITI summer Training

Welcome to my ITI Summer Training repository! This summer, I will be focusing on learning and developing projects using .NET web development and the C# programming language. This repository will serve as a place to document my progress, share my tasks, and keep a record of the solutions I create. This way, I can refer back to my work at any time in the future.


## Goals for the Summer
- In this repo I will share my tasks and solved task to can back for it at any time.
Here are some resources to help you get started:

1. Learn C#: Gain a solid understanding of C# as it is new to me.
2. learn .NET Web Development: Get hands-on experience with .NET technologies for web development.
3. Complete Projects: Apply my learning by developing projects using C# and .NET.
4. Document My Journey: Keep a detailed record of tasks, solutions, and projects in this repository.
